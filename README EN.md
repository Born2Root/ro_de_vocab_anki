### Usage

0. Download or clone the repo

1. Import the deck (.apkg file) into Anki

2. 

3. In case you only want to practice irregular verbs, that's also possible. Just select and suspend all notes that have a 'r' (for regular) in the field 'type'. You can do so by typing `type:r` in the browser.

4. Repositioning: if you want to learn some verbs earlier than others, select the notes and use the reposion command in the browser. Take a look in the [manual](http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#other-menu-items) for further information.

5. If you want to use the spreadsheet in order to import it into Anki, you can do so. Make sure you convert the spreadsheet into a csv-file with utf8 encoding (e.g. with LibreOffice -> save a copy). Be aware to NOT USE the comma as a seperator since the example sentences contain commas. Use semicolons `;` instead.

6. additional recommandations: in order to learn the most importand verbs first, go to the deck options, go to the 'new cards' tab and check whether the order is set to `show cards in order added` and uncheck `bury related new cards`.
